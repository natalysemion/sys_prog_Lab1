Let's say we have a text file that has no restrictions on its size. We also do not impose a limit on the length of a line in this file.
Text consists of words, for example, identifiers of the English language. Words are interspersed with spaces, parentheses, operation codes, generally symbols that naturally separate words from each other. We will not deal with the spelling of such words either. Let us limit the word length to 30 letters.
In the result field, you need to display words without repetitions that satisfy a certain condition.
